1. Path integration: so that after finding the food source the ant can go straight forward to the nest location using only the relative calculated Angle and distance approximation.

2. Richest food source: implement a model where the colony can choose between different food sources but each one have a different nutritional value than the others.

3.  recruitment: 
Mechanic: 	A. by carring an ant of the next to the food source 
		B. tandem guiding by little touch of ant to the leader 		body
Chamical:  C. spreading a pheromone to comunicate other ants   			around help is requiered to carry a big nutritious 			food piece 

measures
Energetic efficiency. (need to be defined)
Length of permanent trails. (search an strategy to do this)
Amount of resources collected within a time window. (this is done by days)
Average amount of energy per unit of food collected.
Distribution of ants by type of food.
Distribution of ants in the different states. (this is already done)
Amount of food available in the environment over time.
Foraging decisions: Quality vs. distance.
